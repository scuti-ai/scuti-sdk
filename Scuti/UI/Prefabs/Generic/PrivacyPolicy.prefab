    cares about your privacy and knows that you also care about how information about
    you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully
    and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Scuti.store,
    you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.\r\n\r\nWhat
    Personal Information About Customers Does Scuti.com Gather?\r\nWhat About Cookies?\r\nDoes
    Scuti.com Share the Information It Receives?\r\nHow Secure Is Information About
    Me?\r\nWhat About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?\r\nWhich
    Information Can I Access?\r\nWhat Choices Do I Have?\r\nAre Children Allowed to
    Use Scuti.com?\r\nEU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield\r\nConditions of Use, Notices,
    and Revisions\r\nExamples of Information Collected\r\nWhat Personal Information
    About Customers Does Scuti.com Gather?\r\nThe information we learn from customers
    helps us personalize and continually improve your Scuti\u2122 experience. Here
    are the types of information we gather.\r\n\r\nInformation You Give Us: We receive
    and store any information you enter on our Web site, Scuti\u2122 store, or give
    us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then
    you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features and the specific
    products and deals based on your preferences. We use the information that you
    provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping
    for you, improving the deals and offers our vendors will offer, and communicating
    with you.\r\nAutomatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information
    whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites and Apps, we use
    \"cookies,\" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser
    accesses Scuti.store or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf
    of Scuti.store on other Web sites.\r\nMobile: When you download or use the Scuti\u2122
    app or shop from games with the Scuti\u2122 API, we may receive information about
    your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device.
    We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such
    as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices
    allow you to turn off location services.\r\nE-mail Communications: To help us
    make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when
    you open e-mail from Scuti.store if your computer supports such capabilities.
    We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an
    effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want
    to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication
    Preferences.\r\nInformation from Other Sources: We might receive information about
    you from other sources and add it to our account information.\r\nWhat About Cookies?\r\nCookies
    are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to
    recognize your device and to provide features such as one-step purchasing, deals
    and products recommended for you, personalized advertisements and storage of items
    in your Shopping Cart between visits.\r\nThe Help feature on most browsers will
    tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
    browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
    Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons,
    such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site
    of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Scuti.com's
    essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance,
    if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items
    to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Scuti.com products and
    services that require you to Sign in.\r\nDoes Scuti.com Share the Information
    It Receives?\r\nInformation about our customers is an important part of our business,
    and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Scuti\u2122 shares and
    sells aggregated data of all the activity on our site to vendors and other third
    parties so they can offer our shoppers the best deals. No personally identifiable
    information is ever shared with any third party.\r\n\r\nAffiliated Businesses
    We Do Not Control: We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases,
    such as Marketplace vendors, these businesses operate sell offerings to you at
    Scuti.store. Scuti\u2122 only shares aggregated store data with these third parties
    and never personally identifiable information, other than the specifics needed
    to fulfill your orders, such as items purchased and delivery address.\r\nThird-Party
    Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
    on our behalf. Examples include e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer
    lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card
    payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.\r\nPromotional
    Offers: We send offers to selected groups of Scuti.store customers on behalf of
    other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and
    address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer
    Communication Preferences.\r\nProtection of Scuti.store and Others: We release
    account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
    to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements;
    or protect the rights, property, or safety of Scuti.store, our users, or others.
    This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
    fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not
    include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable
    information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments
    set forth in this Privacy Notice.\r\nWith Your Consent: Other than as set out
    above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties,
    and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.\r\nHow
    Secure Is Information About Me?\r\nWe work to protect the security of your information
    during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts
    information you input.\r\nWe reveal only the last four digits of your credit card
    numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card
    number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.\r\nIt is
    important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and
    to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.\r\nWhich
    Information Can I Access?\r\nScuti.store gives you access to a broad range of
    information about your account and your interactions with Scuti.store for the
    limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.\r\n\r\nWhat
    Choices Do I Have?\r\nYou can always choose not to provide information, even though
    it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Scuti.store
    features as Your Profile, Wish Lists , Customer Reviews, and Scuti\u2122 Rewards.\r\nYou
    can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the
    Account section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior
    version for our records.\r\nIf you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail
    from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences . (If you do not
    want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this
    Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Scuti.store, and it
    is your responsibility to review them for changes.)\r\nIf you do not want us to
    use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize
    advertisements and product promotions and deals we display to you, please adjust
    your Advertising Preferences.\r\nThe Help feature on most browsers will tell you
    how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
    notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
    Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons,
    such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site
    of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Scuti.store's
    essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance,
    if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items
    to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Scuti.store products and
    services that require you to Sign in.\r\nAre Children Allowed to Use Scuti.com?\r\nScuti.com
    does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for
    purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Scuti.store only with the
    involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information
    from children under the age of 13 without the consent of the child's parent or
    guardian.\r\n\r\nEU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield\r\nScuti\u2122 LLC. participates
    in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks.\r\n\r\nConditions of Use,
    Notices, and Revisions\r\nIf you choose to visit Scuti.store, your visit and any
    dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including
    limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of
    the state of Connecticut. If you have any concern about privacy at Scuti.store,
    please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
    Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of
    Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions,
    but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated
    otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have
    about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and
    will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective
    of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected
    customers.\r\n\r\nExamples of Information Collected Information You Give Us\r\nYou
    provide most such information when you search, buy, post a review, log in, participate
    in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example,
    you provide information when you search for a product; place an order through
    Scuti.store; provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than
    one if you have used more than one e-mail address when shopping with us) or Your
    Profile ; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire
    or a contest entry form; view videos which provide Scuti\u2122 Crypto Rewards;

    might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers;
    credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped, including
    addresses and phone number; content of reviews and e-mails to us; and personal
    profile information.\r\n\r\nAutomatic Information\r\nExamples of the information
    we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect
    your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection
    information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in
    types and versions, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we
    sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features
    like Top Sellers ; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through,
    and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed
    or searched for. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also
    known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our
    Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use
    software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information,
    including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages,
    page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and
    methods used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical information
    to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.\r\n\r\nMobile\r\nMost
    mobile devices provide users with the ability to disable location services. Most
    likely, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have
    questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you
    contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.\r\n\r\nInformation

    updated delivery and address information from our vendors, which we use to correct
    our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; account

    some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide
    technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search term and search
    result information from some searches conducted through the Web search features.\r\n\r\nInformation
