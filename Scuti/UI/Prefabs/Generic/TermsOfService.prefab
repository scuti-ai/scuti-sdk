  m_Text: "8. Placing an Order\r\nOrder Acceptance and Billing\r\nYou represent and
    warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other means of payment
    that you provide to us. By providing payment card information to us, you authorize
    us to store and use the card as a payment method for purchases made through your
    Scuti\u2122 account, including on Scuti\u2122 affiliated sites and properties
    which you access via your Scuti\u2122 account credentials. Scuti\u2122 participates
    in account update services offered by some banks. If your bank participates in
    account updater services, these services will automatically update your card number
    or expiration date in our system when it changes. If you do not want to have your
    cards automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your
    issuing bank. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate.
    Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information is a breach of these Terms
    of Use and may result in cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order
    we may also request additional information from you. Verification of information
    may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any purchase. We
    reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations
    on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing
    information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department.
    If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has
    been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable
    payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will attempt to contact you if
    all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required
    to accept your order. Scuti\u2122 may request a pre-authorization for some orders
    placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be
    billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period.
    Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held.
    We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient
    funds to complete the transaction.\r\n\r\nBy confirming your purchase at the end
    of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the Products, as well
    as all shipping and handling charges and applicable taxes. You will not be charged
    for most orders until the order has shipped. Some exceptions (when you will be
    charged at the time your order is placed) are: (i) orders or preorders paid for
    with a Gift Card, eGift Card, or PayPal account; and (ii) orders paid using the
    in-store \u201CCash\u201D payment method.Scuti\u2122 reserves the right, including
    without prior notice, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per
    household, or per order for any reason. We will attempt to notify you should such
    limits be applied. Scuti\u2122 also reserves the right, at our sole discretion,
    to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use,
    \u201Creselling\u201D will be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any
    Product(s) from Scuti\u2122 for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of
    the same Product(s) to a third party.\r\n\r\nPricing Information; Availability\r\nScuti\u2122
    cannot confirm the price or availability of an item until after your order is
    placed. Pricing or availability errors may occur on the Scuti\u2122 Sites or through
    Marketplace Vendors. The receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute
    our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product.
    Scuti\u2122 reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability
    errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order
    confirmation or shipping notice from Scuti\u2122. Scuti\u2122 may, at its discretion,
    either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such
    cancellation. Pricing for products may be different on the Scuti\u2122 Sites or
    from prices available in Scuti\u2122 stores or on Scuti\u2122 Apps.\r\n\r\nPromotional
    Codes\r\nPromotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or be discontinued
    with or without notice. Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law. Promotional
    codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise transferred. They are not redeemable
    for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason
    without notice. We reserve the right in our discretion to impose conditions on
    the offering of any promotional code.\r\n\r\nGift Cards\r\nThe risk of loss and
    title to any gift cards passes to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission
    to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Your purchase
    and use of gift cards is subject to the full terms and conditions related to gift
    cards, available at http://help.Scuti/app/answers/detail/a_id/57.\r\n\r\n9. Shipping
    and Delivery\r\nProducts will be shipped to an address designated by you, if applicable,
    so long as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions
    contained on the Scuti\u2122 Sites. All transactions are made pursuant to a shipping
    contract, and, as a result, risk of loss and title for Products pass to you upon
    delivery of the Products to the carrier.\r\n\r\nDelivery of Products purchased
    from the Scuti\u2122 Sites to addresses outside the United States is limited.
    Some Products also have restricted delivery within the United States. Some Products
    may be available for pick up at physical Vendor store locations. Estimated delivery
    times are determined based on the method of shipping chosen when Products are
    purchased and the destination of the Products. Scuti\u2122 does not ship products
    itself. All products purchased are shipped direct from the Vendor.\r\n\r\n10.
    Export Policy\r\nYou acknowledge that (a) goods licensed or sold on the Scuti\u2122
    Sites, and (b) any software or technology purchased, downloaded, or used from
    the Scuti\u2122 Sites, are subject to the customs and export control laws and
    regulations of the United States of America and may also be subject to the customs
    and export laws and regulations of the country in which the products are manufactured

    represent, and warrant that no Materials will be accessed from, downloaded in,
    released in, carried to, transferred to, transshipped through, exported to, or

    resident thereof), person, entity, or organization to which such Materials could
    not be transferred directly from the United States or by a U.S. person without

    the Scuti\u2122 Sites may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms
    of Use. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules
    as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these
    Terms of Use, the Promotion rules will govern.\r\n\r\n16. Terms Applicable to
    Special Scuti\u2122 Services\r\nScuti\u2122 Marketplace\r\nScuti\u2122 operates
    an online marketplace program on the Scuti\u2122 Sites which enables Marketplace
    Vendors to sell their products and, once an order is placed, to ship such Marketplace
    Vendors\u2019 products directly to the customer (the \u201CScuti\u2122 Marketplace\u201D).
    Any use of the Scuti\u2122 Marketplace is subject to the following additional
    terms:\r\n\r\nWhen we say \u201CMarketplace Vendor,\u201D we mean any entity or
    retailer that sells goods or services in the Scuti\u2122 Marketplace through the
    Scuti\u2122 Sites, uses any order processing, fulfillment, shipping, or other
    services related to the Scuti\u2122 Marketplace provided by or for Scuti\u2122,
    or uses any platform, portal, web service, application, interface, or other tool
    provided by or for Scuti\u2122 in connection with the Scuti\u2122 Marketplace.\r\nBy
    purchasing a product from any of our Marketplace Vendors, you acknowledge that
    all Scuti\u2122 Marketplace orders will be fulfilled by the third party Marketplace
    Vendor and not Scuti\u2122. The Marketplace Vendor (and not Scuti\u2122) will
    be responsible for all processing, shipping, returns, and customer service related
    to your Scuti\u2122 Marketplace order. Products purchased from a Marketplace Vendor
    can only be returned to that Marketplace Vendor in accordance with its return
    policy and cannot be returned to Scuti\u2122 stores or Scuti\u2122. Each Marketplace
    Vendor\u2019s shipping information, return policy, customer service information,
    and Marketplace Privacy Policy can be found on that Marketplace Vendor\u2019s
    Seller Information page. For other terms that apply to Scuti\u2122 Marketplace,
    including important notices and disclosures, see About Marketplace.\r\nTo the
    fullest extent provided by applicable law, Scuti\u2122 has no responsibility or
    liability for any Marketplace Vendor or their products.\r\niOS Scuti\u2122 App\r\nIn
    addition to your agreement with these Terms of Use, the following provisions apply
    with respect to your use of any version of the Scuti\u2122 App compatible with

    a party to these Terms of Use and does not own and is not responsible for any
    Scuti\u2122 App. Apple is not providing any warranty for the Scuti\u2122 App except,
    if applicable, to refund the purchase price for it. Apple is not responsible for
    maintenance or other support services for the Scuti\u2122 App and will not be
    responsible for any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses

    claims, claims that the Scuti\u2122 App fails to conform to any applicable legal
    or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar
    legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any
    inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the Scuti\u2122 App, including
    those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to Scuti\u2122
    in accordance with the \u201CHow to Contact Us\u201D section.\r\nThe license you
    have been granted in these Terms of Use is limited to a non-transferable license
    to use the Scuti\u2122 App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple\u2019s
    iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted
    by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple\u2019s App Store Terms of Service. In addition,
    you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you
    when using the Scuti\u2122 App, such as your wireless data service agreement.\r\nYou
    represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject
    to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government
    as a \u201Cterrorist supporting\u201D country; and (2) you are not listed on any
    U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\r\nApple and Apple\u2019s
    subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use and, upon your
    acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, will have the right
    (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Use
    against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing,
    Scuti\u2122\u2019s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver,
    or settlement under these Terms of Use is not subject to the consent of any third
    party.\r\nOrders\r\nsetting out what you have ordered. This is not an order confirmation
    or acceptance from us.\r\nAll prices quoted are exclusive of tax and you will
    see estimated taxes and fees when you place the order. The final taxes and fees
    will be calculated on the day your order is picked and delivered, or picked up,
    as applicable. In the event your order must be fulfilled using products of different
    weight or volume than what you ordered, you will be charged only for the actual
    weight or volume delivered.\r\nDue to shipment and delivery times, there are limitations
    on when changes or cancellations to orders can be made. These limitations will
    be provided when you place your order. For orders that are delivered to you, title
    to the goods purchased by you and the related risk of loss on these items passes
    to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier.\r\nWe may, in our discretion,
    provide you with a refund in certain circumstances. If you are not satisfied with
    your order, please contact the Scuti\u2122 Contact Center at contact@scuti.store.\r\nWe
    will not provide you a refund for certain goods which by nature cannot be returned.
    Such items include items which cannot be resold for health and hygiene reasons
    once unwrapped (for example body jewelry, mattresses, bedding, certain items of
    clothing, personal grooming products, medicines, and certain baby products, etc.).\r\nNotwithstanding
    the foregoing, all refunds will be subject to our discretion.\r\nAccounts\r\nRewards.
    From time to time, you may be offered Scuti\u2122 Crypto credits which allow you
    to redeem or exchange these rewards for in-game credits to registered video games
    in the Scuti\u2122 Marketplace. Such rewards are intended for your use only and
    are not to be sold by you and may be governed by rules that are separate from
    these Terms. We reserve the right to restrict access to rewards redemptions in
    the event of a violation of these Terms of Use and to modify, terminate, or otherwise
    amend our credits and promotional offerings.\r\nCancellations and Refunds. You
    may cancel your Scuti\u2122 account at any time by contacting customer support
    at support at support@scuti.store. Any remaining Scuti\u2122 Crypto balance in
    your account will be terminated at that time unless you gift or transfer your
    Scuti\u2122 Crypto to another registered Scuti\u2122 account. Once your account
    has been closed, you will need to register as a new user.\r\nAccount Access. If
    you believe that you may be victim of identity theft involving your Scuti\u2122
    account, you should notify customer service and report any information about this
    instance to your card issuers and local law enforcement. We reserve the right
    to place any account on hold at any time with or without notification to you in
    order to protect ourselves and our partners from what we believe to be fraudulent
    activity. We are not obligated to credit or discount a membership for holds placed
    on the account by either a representative of us or by any automated process.\r\nAccount

    pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July
    1, 2014 (the \u201CJAMS Rules\u201D) and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate.
    The JAMS Rules, including instructions for bringing arbitration, are available
    on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. The
    Minimum Standards are available at http://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe
    arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference,
    rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request
    by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances
    will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with
    due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
    If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be
    made by JAMS or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator\u2019s decision will follow
    the terms of these Terms of Use and will be final and binding. The arbitrator
    will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief
    or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms of Use, but only to
    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before
    the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced
    in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
    nothing in these Terms of Use will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
    of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief
    against us for you.\r\n\r\nThese Terms of Use will be governed by and construed
    under the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the
    State of California, without regard to conflicts of law principles."

    and supersede all prior agreements and representations between the parties with
    respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not,
    and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee,
    agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Scuti\u2122. Headings
    used in these Terms of Use are for reference purposes only and in no way define
    or limit the scope of the section. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held
    to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed only to the
    extent necessary to make it enforceable and the other terms of these Terms of
    Use will remain in full force and effect. The failure of Scuti\u2122 to act with
    respect to a breach of these Terms of Use by you or others does not constitute
    a waiver and will not limit Scuti\u2122's rights with respect to such breach or
    any subsequent breaches. You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all
    of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Use without our express prior
    written consent. We may assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all of our rights
    or obligations under these Terms of Use without restriction. Any use of the term

    notices of changes to this these Terms of Use) may be made via posting to the
    Scuti\u2122 Sites or by e-mail (including in each case via links), or by regular

    given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings
    based upon or relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to
    the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated
